                      --->>> Why should use it? <<<---
          Library can for Exception Managing in Multi Layer Architecture Project.

                      --->>> What is available in the library? <<<---
          In each layer, there are separate util class methods for exception managing. 
        These methods perform the operation, if an error is received in this operation, 
        the error is processed and an exception is thrown. Or the exception is thrown 
        directly to the upper layer without handling the error. For Controller classes, 
        when an exception is thrown from the lower layers, an error class can be returned 
        for this exception.

                      --->>> What is the alternative to this library? <<<---
          General Exception Managing can be managed with various annotations within 
        the Spring Framework's various Libraries.
